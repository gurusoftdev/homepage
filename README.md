## Getting Started

For configuration options, examples and more, [please check out the Wiki](https://github.com/benphelps/homepage/wiki).

### With Docker

Using docker compose:

```yaml
version: '3.3'
services:
    homepage:
        image: ghcr.io/benphelps/homepage:latest
        container_name: homepage
        ports:
            - 3000:3000
        volumes:
            - /path/to/config:/app/config
            - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # (optional) For docker integrations
```

or docker run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/config:/app/config -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ghcr.io/benphelps/homepage:latest
```

### With Node

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benphelps/homepage.git
```

Then install dependencies and build the production bundle (I'm using pnpm here, you can use npm or yarn if you like):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Finally, run the server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Configuration

Configuration files will be genereted and placed on the first request.

Configuration is done in the /config directory using .yaml files.  Refer to each config for
the specific configuration options.

You may also check [the wiki](https://github.com/benphelps/homepage/wiki) for detailed configuration instructions, examples and more.

## Development

Install NPM packages, this project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (and so should you!):

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, see their doucmentation for more information:
